Homie
=====

Homie is a lightweight MQTT convention for the IoT.

You can find an implementation of the Homie convention:

* A device Arduino library built for the ESP8266 at [marvinroger/homie-esp8266](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266)
* An opinionated Web UI built with Node.js at [marvinroger/homie-server](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-server)
* Some Node-RED nodes for automation at [marvinroger/node-red-contrib-homie](https://github.com/marvinroger/node-red-contrib-homie)

## Background

An instance of a physical piece of hardware (an Arduino, an ESP8266...) is called a **device**. A device has **device properties**, like the current local IP, the Wi-Fi signal, etc. A device can expose multiple **nodes**. For example, a weather device might expose a `temperature` node and an `humidity` node. A node can have multiple **node properties**. The `temperature` node might for example expose a `degrees` property containing the actual temperature, and an `unit` property. Node properties can be **settable**. For example, you don't want your `degrees` property to be settable in case of a temperature sensor: this depends on the environment and it would not make sense to change it. However, you will want the `degrees` property to be settable in case of a thermostat.

## QoS and retained messages

The nature of the Homie convention makes it safe about duplicate messages, so the recommended QoS for reliability is **QoS 1**. All messages MUST be sent as **retained**, UNLESS stated otherwise.

## Convention

Version: **2.0.0**.

Homie devices communicate through MQTT.

To efficiently parse messages, Homie defines a few rules related to topic names. The base topic you will see in the following convention will be `devices/`. You can however choose whatever base topic you want.

* `devices` / **`device ID`**: this is the base topic of a device. Each device must have a unique device ID. This ID MAY contain only lowercase letters from `a` to `z`, numbers from `0` to `9`, and it MAY contain `-`, but MUST NOT start or end with a `-`.

### Device properties

* `devices` / **`device ID`** / `$` **`device property`**: a topic starting with a `$` after the base topic of a device represents a device property. A device property MUST be one of these:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$nodes</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Nodes the device has, with format <code>id:type</code> separated by a <code>,</code> if there are multiple nodes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$ota</td>
    <td>Controller → Device</td>
    <td>Latest OTA version available for the device</td>
    <td>Yes or No, depending of your implementation</td>
    <td>No, OTA is optional</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$implementation</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>An identifier for the Homie implementation (example <code>esp8266</code>)</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$implementation/#</td>
    <td>Controller → Device or Device → Controller</td>
    <td>You can use any subtopics of <code>$implementation</code> for anything related to your specific Homie implementation.</td>

  </tr>
</table>

For example, a device with an ID of `686f6d6965` with a temperature and an humidity sensor would send:

```
devices/686f6d6965/$online → true
devices/686f6d6965/$name → Bedroom temperature sensor
devices/686f6d6965/$localip → 192.168.0.10
devices/686f6d6965/$signal → 72
devices/686f6d6965/$fw/name → 1.0.0
devices/686f6d6965/$fw/version → 1.0.0
devices/686f6d6965/$nodes → temperature:temperature,humidity:humidity
```

And it would receive:

```
devices/686f6d6965/$ota ← 1.0.1
devices/686f6d6965/$reset ← false
```

At this point, your device would understand there is an OTA update available, as `$ota` is different from `$fw/version`.

### Node properties

* `devices` / **`device ID`** / **`node ID`** / **`property`**: `node ID` is the ID of the node, as defined in the `$nodes` device property. `property` is the property of the node that is getting updated.

For example, our `686f6d6965` above would send:

```
devices/686f6d6965/temperature/degrees → 12.07
devices/686f6d6965/humidity/percentage → 79
```

* `devices` / **`device ID`** / **`node ID`** / **`property`** / `set`: the device can subscribe to this topic if the property is **settable** from the controller, in case of actuators.

Homie is state-based. You don't tell your smarlight to turn on, but you tell it to put it's `on` state to `true`. This especially fits well with MQTT, because of retained message.

For example, an `homielight` device exposing a `light` node would subscribe to `devices/homielight/light/on/set` and it would receive:

```
devices/homielight/light/on/set ← true
```

The device would then turn on the light, and update its `on` state. This provides pessimistic feedback, which is important for home automation.

```
devices/homielight/light/on → true
```

Any other topic is not part of the Homie convention.

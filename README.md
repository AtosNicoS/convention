This repository is kind of a *spec*, everything interesting is located [in the Wiki](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie/wiki).

You can find an implementation of the Homie system:

* A server part built with Node.js at [marvinroger/homie-server](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-server)
* A device Arduino library built for the ESP8266 at [marvinroger/homie-esp8266](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266)
